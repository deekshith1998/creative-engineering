Welcome to Creative Engineering Project // Coding with fun!

We are excited to have you contribute to our open source project. Here are some basic rules to follow:

Create a new branch. This will allow you to work on your changes without affecting the main branch of the repository.
Make your changes. Be sure to follow the project's coding style guide and commit your changes frequently.
Submit a pull request. Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request to the main branch of the repository.
HacktoberFest

Register for HacktoberFest. You can register on the HacktoberFest website.
Make at least one pull request to an open source project during the month of October.

Additional guidelines

Be respectful. Please treat other contributors with respect, even if you disagree with them.
Write clear and concise commits. Your commit messages should be clear and concise, and they should describe what changes you made.
Test your changes. Before submitting a pull request, please test your changes to make sure they work as expected.

Additional tips

Read the project's documentation. This will help you to understand the project's codebase and how to contribute effectively.

**Have fun!**Contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn new skills and help others.
We hope these guidelines help you to contribute to our project in a meaningful way. Thank you!
